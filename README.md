# Predicting Iris species with Deep learning
In this project, we will use Deep learning to predict Iris species. It is a multi-class classification problem where each class corresponds to a species of Iris (*Iris Setosa*, *Iris Versicolour* and *Iris Virginica*). The dataset for this project is the famous [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

**Toolkit**: Python, Tensorflow, Neural network
