# Predicting Iris species with Deep Learning
In this project, we use a Deep Learning approach to predict Iris species.
It is a multi-class classification problem where each class corresponds to a species of Iris (*Iris Setosa*, *Iris Versicolour* and *Iris Virginica*). The dataset for this project is the famous [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The final model is a 3-layer neural network that predicts an Iris species with 96.6% accuracy.

**Toolkit**: Python, TensorFlow, Neural network, Adam optimizer
